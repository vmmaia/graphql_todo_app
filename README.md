This is a personal project of a simple todo application that allows users to create, read, update and delete tasks.

The application is built with ReactJS and GraphQL on the frontend, and NodeJS and TypeScript on the backend.

This was made as an exercise to familiarize my self with the technology stack of this project, with special emphasis on GraphQL and Apollo.
